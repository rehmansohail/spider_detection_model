# Spider Classification Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the probability of a spider being malignant based on its size.

## Implementation
The code reads the training data, creates a logistic regression model, and performs tests with different cutoff values to evaluate sensitivity. The final results are visualized in a bar plot.

## Requirements
- R
- Rstudio

## Results
We can see as a higher cutoff is used the senstivity of the model decreases
